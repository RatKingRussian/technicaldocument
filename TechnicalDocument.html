                <p> When it comes to the classes of FFXIV Tanking is truly one of the most unique classes you can choose to partake in. When it comes to the basic gameplay one could describe it as being that guy. By using the proper mixture of Mitigation, and Emnity control you become the parties shield or in some cases its destructive leader. Take the time to learn from our current information and see if Tanking is for you!</p>
                <p>In this little journey we will go over the different aspects needed to understand when it comes to tanking, as well as the coordinationa and mindset you need to keep in mind when you're playing the class!</p>
                <p>When it comes to tanking here are the different tanks you can choose from. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>Paladin</code></li>
                        <li><code>Dark Knight</code></li>
                        <li><code>Gunbreaker</code></li>
                        <li><code>Warrior</code></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Emnity">
            <header class="main_header">Emnity</header>
            <p>The main goal of a tank is to gain all the attention of the enemies so that they do not attack the rest of the party. This is done through emnity! Enmity is essentially how high of a priority you are on then enemies list. When you active what is called your tank stance your attacks will put you at the top of the enemies emnity list and for longer. each tank has its own unique tank stance which, when used along your AOE attacks will make sure you are the life of the party (everyone wants to kill you)!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>Paladin/Iron Will</code></li>
                    <li><code>Dark Knight/Grit</code></li>
                    <li><code>Gunbreaker/Royal Gaurd</code></li>
                    <li><code>Warrior/Defiance</code></li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>you can find an example of emnity lists <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0neQAij.png">here<a>!</a></p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Mitigation">
            <header class="main_header">Mitigation</header>
            <p>Mitigation is the act of reducing how much damag e you take from your enemies! This is done through your mitigation abilities! these can be a variety of different abilities you can weave in between your normal powers! Each one varies in how much damage it does so it's important you space them out properly in between pulls. </p>
            <p>Great examples of mitigation can be things like each tanks Fortress! This mitigation reduces enemy damage to you by 40%! Each tank has several mitigations that work like this, however even uncommon mits like Arm's Length (which reduces enemies automatic attack speed) can be useful in many situations so be sure to experiment and use the mits in well timed ways!</p>
            <p>Each tank also has what is called an invulnerability ability! Each one, except for Paladin which just gets 10 seconds of flat damage negation, has special parameters though so be sure to read and practice said invuls so you can use them at the optimal times!</p>

            <header class="main_header">Leading</header>
            <p>When it comes to tanking you are the defacto leader. how fast or slow you achieve the ending of the dungeon can depend on your skill and speed of running through it. Slow pulls are when you pull only 1 group of enemies at a time allowing for easy health management and less mitigation usage. Going slow is highly recommended for beginner tanks and ther is no shame in doing such! average pulls are when you nab 2 groups ate once. While not generally too difficult its important you keep track of you mitigation usage and with poor skill is even possible to die to.</p>
            <p>Fast Pulls. Fast pulls are generally predecated by what is called a W2W or a Wall to Wall pull. These pulls are usually when you pull every enemy along the rout until you the hit the boss. It is very importany you most likely use your unvulnerability skill at the end of these pulls to give yourself some time without death so that you can have more mits to keep yourself alive. Communication with your healer for this can be important depending on the content so be sure you are completely ready for such a thing!</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Healers">
            <header class="main_header">Healers</header>
            <p>When it comes to tanking having good communication with your healer is of vital importance. Healers main jobs are literally to keep you alive. 90% of the time when they are not doing DPS or healing other teammates they will be using mitagations and healing abilities on YOU. It is important you understand when some healers need you to go slower or are ok with faster pull speeds. If you're having difficulty goin through a dungeon be sure to have a discussion with your healer and figuring out what either of you need to work on. Remember you are a team! </p>
